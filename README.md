# Coursework
year 1

The first stage of my coursework is completed according to the requirements. In particular, I have researched several APIs and chose and described in great detail the one I am going to be working with (as well as the one I will also need as an additional tool). On top of that, I have touched upon what is the goal of my project and how I will implement it.

The second stage of the coursework has been completed as well. I have researched what can be done using XML Processing Modules and provided an example for using one of the submodules.
